The Walking Dead Season Two

Tested on build from 1st April 2019

Launch options used (if any):
None

Symptoms:
Loads a window and crashes instantly if in fullscreen mode
Crashes once you get past the intro things (when the click is first meaningful) if not in fullscreen mode

Remarks:
Better than the first?

See log

I would say 'see video' but bandicam couldn't handle it crashing?
