Main:

Red Faction: Armageddon

Tested on build from April 22nd 2019

Launch options used (if any):
From git bash:
export DXVK_HUD=1
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=none
./rf4_launcher.exe -packfiles
(But seems relatively ineffective)

Symptoms:
Seems to be able to render menus and stuff just fine, and playback videos fine too. Cutscenes are okay too (in-engine ones), but when you get into actual gameplay it immediately hangs.

Remarks:
See log
