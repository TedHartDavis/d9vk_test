ETS2

Tested on build from April 1st 2019

Launch options used (if any):
Tried:
From git bash:
export DXVK_HUD=1
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=none
./eurotrucks2.exe -rdevice dx9
However, while that's the exact command Steam issues, I can't get it to actually launch the game with DX that way.
So, instead:
Right-click; run with DirectX (32-bit)

Symptoms:
Seems perfect
