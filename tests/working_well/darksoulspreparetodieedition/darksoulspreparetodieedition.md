Dark Souls: Prepare To Die Edition

Tested on build from May 22nd 2019

Launch options used (if any):
From git bash:
export DXVK_HUD=1
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=none
./DARKSOULS.exe
But doesn't seem to want to try to launch, despite being through the same command as Steam itself seems to issue
So, launched through Steam, and while no DXVK HUD, can confirm it works with Bandicam

Symptoms:
Seems like a bad console port running pretty much okay, with some framedrops

Remarks:
