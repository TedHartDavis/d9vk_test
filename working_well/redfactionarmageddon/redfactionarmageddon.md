Red Faction: Armageddon

Tested on build from May 20th 2019

Launch options used (if any):
From git bash:
export DXVK_HUD=1
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=none
./RedFactionArmageddon.exe -packfiles
(But seems relatively ineffective)

Symptoms:
Seems to run perfectly, aside from the lack of DXVK_HUD

Remarks:
Seems great!
