Portal

Tested on build from May 18th 2019

Launch options used (if any):
From git bash:
export DXVK_HUD=1
export DXVK_LOG_LEVEL=none
./hl2.exe -steam -game portal

Symptoms:
I didn't run the arguments to fix the launch video, my bad.
Some things don't render properly - weird reflections of light around buttons, some tiles...I don't remember rendering as blcak, emancipation grilles, the auras around portals...

Remarks:
