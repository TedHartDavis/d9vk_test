Launched with these launch options:
-w 1920 -h 1080 -windowed -noborder +mat_disable_d3d9ex 1 +mat_d3d9ex_disabled 1 -dxlevel 90 +mat_dxlevel 90

For this one, I decided to run the inbuilt graphics test. Note that any stuttering observed is probably caused by the way the camera is hardcoded to move by the test.

PC Specs (for what they matter):

RAM - 32GB DDR3 at 1333MHz
